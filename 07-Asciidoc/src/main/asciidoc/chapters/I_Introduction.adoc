== I. Introduction

Given the increasing importance of data standards for e-Procurement, a number of initiatives driven by the public sector, the industry and academia have been kick started in the recent years. Some have grown organically, while others are the result of standardisation work. The vocabularies and the semantics that they are introducing, the phases of public procurement that they are covering, and the technologies that they are using all differ. These differences hamper data interoperability and thus its reuse by them or by the wider public. 

This creates the need for a common data standard for publishing procurement data, hence allowing data from different sources to be easily accessed and linked, and consequently reused. 
This document describes the efforts made by the European Commission to develop such a standard through the developemtn of an "*eProcurement Ontology*" (henceforth referred to as the ePO). 

The ultimate objective of the ePO is to put forth a commonly agreed OWL Ontology that will conceptualise, formally encode and make available in an open, structured and machine-readable format data about public procurement, covering it from end to end, i.e. from notification, through tendering to awarding, ordering, invoicing and payment. The figure below represents the eProcurement Value-Chain as commonly envisaged in Europe (source: OP).
