1. The Ontology development repository branches (this section), for the public distribution of any resource related to the Ontology;
2. The [Issues](https://github.com/eProcurement-everis/O3PO/issues) section, where any question, doubt and specific topics are presented and discussed;
3. The [Projects](https://github.com/eProcurement-everis/O3PO/projects) section, reserved to organise the TO-DOs tasks, events, project milestones, etc.;
4. The [Wiki](https://github.com/eProcurement-everis/O3PO/wiki), a section dedicated to organise and document the final decisions made by the working group and at analysis, design and implementation time.
