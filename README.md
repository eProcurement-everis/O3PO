# O3PO - The OP's Public eProcurement Ontology

## Role and main functions
The O3PO repository has been set up to support the collaborative work around the development of the e-procurement ontology.
This repository is divided into different sections:
1. Ontology committed in different versions.
2. The wiki (https://github.com/eProcurement-everis/O3PO/wiki) documents the evolution of the ontology and the decisions taken into account during its analysis and implementation.
3. The issues (https://github.com/eProcurement-everis/O3PO/issues) section tracks all discussions about the ontology.
