# O3PO - The OP's Public eProcurement Ontology

## Role and main functions
This O3PO repository has been set up to support the collaborative work around the development of the Publications Office Public eProcurement Ontology (O3PO).

The repository is divided into different sections:

1. The Ontology development repository branches (this section), for the public distribution of any resource related to the Ontology;
2. The [Issues](https://github.com/eProcurement-everis/O3PO/issues) section, where any question, doubt and specific topics are presented and discussed;
3. The [Projects](https://github.com/eProcurement-everis/O3PO/projects) section, reserved to organise the TO-DOs tasks, events, project milestones, etc.;
4. The [Wiki](https://github.com/eProcurement-everis/O3PO/wiki), a section dedicated to organise and document the final decisions made by the working group and at analysis, design and implementation time.
