== IV. Design and Implementation

All deliverables produced in the previous tasks, e.g. Glossary and DED, but namely the Conceptual Data Model, were
taken into account to produce an OWL ontology.

The outcome of this task are mainly the expression of the ontology link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbox[T-Box] as an
OWL-DL Turtle syntax and a comparison of the tools used (link:https://protege.stanford.edu/products.php[Protégé 5.2]
and link:https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/vocbench3/about[VocBench 3.0]) for the development of the T-Box.

=== ePo 1.0 RDF-XML vocabulary

In ePO v1.0 the Working Group decided that the ontology was to be expressed as an RDF vocabulary. This vocabulary was also
expressed as an RDF-XML syntax: see file
link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/eproc_v0.6.owl[eproc_v0.6.owl]
located in the link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology[root folder] of the
GitHub code repository.

=== ePO v2.0.0 OWL-DL syntax
For this new version ePO v.2.0.0 the ePO development team proposed to the WG to approach the development of the ontology
with the more expressive language link:https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/OWL[OWL DL] (Description Logic), which allows for
advanced reasoning and logic inference, and the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)[Turtle] (TTL) syntax,
as it is more human-readable than the OWL-XML equivalent.

.Automated generation of the ePO-TTL T-Box
[TIP]
====
One way of automatising the generation of the OWL-TTL T-Box is to use the DED jointly with a transformation process and
artefacts (e.g. XSL-T stylesheets for the conversion of the spreadsheet into TTL). This can be used for the generation
of a first draft version that needs to be improved manually, e.g. using Protégé, VocBench or a simple txt editor.
The production of such transformation and artefacts were out of the scope of this phase.
