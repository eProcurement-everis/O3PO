== I. Context

Given the increasing importance of data standards for e-Procurement, a number of initiatives driven by the public sector,
the industry and academia have been launched in the recent years.
Some have grown organically, while others are the result of standardisation work.
The vocabularies and the semantics that they are introducing, the phases of public procurement they are covering,
and the technologies they are using vary greatly amongst themselves.
These differences hamper data interoperability and their reuse.

This situation creates the need for a common representation of the knowledge about the eProcurement domain as it is understood
and practiced in the European Union. For this to happen a common vocabulary, axioms and rules are needed.

In 2016 the link:++https://publications.europa.eu/en/home++[Publications Office of the European Union] (Publications Office or OP)
was commissioned by the link:++https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/home_en++[ISA Programme] to organise and support the development of
such a standard.

This document describes the efforts made by the European Commission to develop the developemtn of an "*eProcurement Ontology*" (henceforth referred to as the ePO).

=== About ePO v1.00

One fundamental document for the development of the eOP is its link:++https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2017-08/d02.02_project_charter_proposal_v1.00_0.pdf++[Project Charter]. This document defines the principles, scope and the foreseen time-line and resources needed to develop the Ontology. 

In this document the ultimate objective was stated as "_to put forth a commonly agreed OWL Ontology that will conceptualise, formally encode and make available in an open, structured and machine-readable format data about public procurement, covering it from end to end, i.e. from notification, through tendering to awarding, ordering, invoicing and payment_". 

The figure below represents the eProcurement Value-Chain as commonly envisaged in Europe (source: OP).

The scope of the Charter was set to cover the "specification showing the conceptual model and its representation in OWL, and the deployment of the ontology and related code lists and classifications on the link:++http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/++[Metadata Registry]".

The original aim was to produce the final Ontology within twelve months including a public review of at least two months; and a set of three deliverables was identified as the main outcome of the project:

.ePO Main Deliverables

For the development of these objectives the OP team proposed a methodological approach based on the recommendations and good practices

image::v1.00_Development_Approach.png[ePO v1.00 - Development methodological approach, 900, align="center"]

Both the Working Group (WG) and the Publications Office (OP) put hands on the work and a version 1.0 of the
eProcurement Ontology (ePO) was delivered in the planned period of 12 months.

=== ePO v.20.0. objectives

The experience of the version 1.0 proved that the goal of developing a whole ontology on
eProcurement that is aligned to the EU legislation and practices was too ambitious to be
completed in 12 months.

Two other relevant conclusions were drawn for that experience:

. The concepts of the ontology needed of common agreed terms and definitions that directed the design
and implementation;

. The development of the ontology requires a "phased" approach based on the Use Cases defined version 1.0 on the one hand,
 but also focused on at least one of the processes of the eProcurement value chain as understood in the European Union (EU).
 See figure 4 above.

Hence the proposal of second version of the ePO ontology, named ePO 2.0.0.

The main objective of the ePO v2.0.0 is to *take leverage of the results produced in version 1.00* and to *extend and hone the OWL Ontology*. To reach these objectives the owners of the project have set the following strategic objectives:

. Focus on only one important policy area, e.g. "*Transparency*";

. Extend and perfect a small set of phases of the eProcurement, if possible only one, e.g. *e-Notification* and *e-Access*.

. Develop and test exhaustively the phase chosen before undertaking the evolution of the ePO into other phases of the eProcurement;

. While developing the selected phase, elicit and define information requirements and data elements that will be used in other phases, even if the selected phases - i.e. eNotification and eAccess-do not use them;

. Select a rich source of information from where to extract data in order to populate and test the ontology, e.g. the TED portal.

=== Scope

Hence *the scope of the ePO v2.0.0 was set to the eNotification and eAccess phases* of the Public eProcurement valuechain,
represented as blue coloured in the figure below:

=== Tasks in-scope

The Knowledge Map (K-Map) footnote:[See link:http://lice.licef.ca/index.php/gmot-motplus-et-mot/["MOTPlus, Modélisation par Object Typés", by LICEF, Téluq]]
method and tools below provides an abstract representation of the objectives, tasks, inputs and outputs of the tasks in the scope of the ePO v2.0.0.

Eac task (ellipses in blue) is used to organise the structure of the rest of this document into four main sections:

* Information elicitation: About the main inputs taken into consideration when identifying information requirement and artefacts used to this elicitation;

* Conceptual Data Model: About the analysis of the information requirements - and business rules-  and the drafting of a simple graphic representation of
the Ontology;

* OWL design and implementation: About the transformation of the Conceptual Data Model into a machine-readable format (TTL) that includes the vocabulary and
the axioms of the ePO;

* ePO testing: About the Proof-of-Concept developed to test and refine the Conceptual Data Model and the OWL implementation.

This other activity diagram, below, provides  a more simplified view of the recurrent (and cyclic) activities of requirements elicitation,
data element definition, analysis, design, implementation and testing:

=== Methodological approach

To reach the strategic objectives stated above this version 2.0.0 of the ePO proposes to
evolve the previous v1.00 based on a few global principles:

. *Business and Information requirements cannot contradict the EU and the Member States
legislation*;

** The ePO Ontology is soundly based on the EU Directives on Public Procurement
footnote:[link:https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32014L0024[Directive 2014/24/EU],
link:https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ%3AJOL_2014_094_R_0001_01[Directive 2014/23/EU],
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014L0025[Directive 2014/25/EU],
link:https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32009L0081[Directive 2009/81/EC] and
link:https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055[Directive 2014/55/EU]],
the ePO glossary, the new eForms Regulation (under consultation), the General Data Protection Regulation
link:https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679[(GDPR)],
and other EU legal frameworks related to the Public Procurement;

. *Information Requirements should be identified through the exhaustive analysis of the business processes*;

** This version 2.0.0 takes as inputs works like the link:http://cenbii.eu/[CEN/BII Workshops], the DG GROWTH's
link:https://github.com/ESPD[ESPD]-related developments, the eSens developments on the VCD and the ESPD (see the ESPDint project), as well as
international standards like UN/CEFACT and OASIS UBL.
Most of them used an UN/CEFACT Universal Method Modelling (UMM) approach that represent the "value-chain Use Cases"
to identify the information requirements exhaustively.
The "value chain Use Cases" eNotification and eAccess are described in these works and cast lists of information
requirements and business rules.

. *Use Cases around the policy area should be defined to (i) complement the identification of information requirements; and (ii) test the completeness, correctness and performance of the Ontology*;

** The link:Use Cases defined in the ePO v1.00 are essential instruments to complete and test the information requirements elicited
during the analysis of the business processes. In this version we propose to focus on the
"link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki/Use-case-1.-Transparency-and-Monitoring[Use Case 1: Data Journalism]"
and the link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki/Use--ase-4.-Analyzing-eProcurement-procedures[Use Case 4: Analysing eProcurement Procedures],
as the eNotification and eAccess provide the largest part of the requirements necessary to implement the case.

. *Reuse of ontologies*:

** There is no point in reinventing models that do already exist and are so generic that they can be reused. That is the case, for example, when the time comes to represent entities like natural person, legal person,
address, etc. Hence, for generic ontologies, we proposed to reuse: W3C's rov (link:https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-regorg/[Registered Organization Vocabulary]),
org (link:https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/[Organization]), skos (link:https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-skos-reference-20080829/skos.html[Simple Knowledge Organization System])
and vCard (link:https://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf/[Virtual Contact File];
originally proposed by the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versit_Consortium[Versit Consortium]);
foaf (link:http://www.foaf-project.org/[Friend of a Friend]).

** On another hand, other lexical (non-ontological) resources and good practices have been taken as models to inspire the drafting of sub-vocabularies
to be imported and reused by the ePO. This has been the case of the CCTS
(link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/v2.0.0/05_Implementation/ttl/ccts.ttl[Core Component Type Specification],
an link:http://www.ebxml.org/[ebXML] model based on the link:https://www.iso.org/standard/61433.html[ISO 15000-5:2014] maintained by UN/CEFACT) for the data types
Identifier, Amount, Quantity and Measure footnote:[*A note about codes*: although the CCTS library defines a
data type for code (CodeType), we decided to use SKOS to represent code list and taxonomy concepts. Therefore this CCTS element is not used in ePO (see
the ePO Conceptual Data Map
"link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/v2.0.0/03_Analysis%20and%20design/EA-Conceptual%20Model/ePO-CM_v2.0.0.eap[ccts package]"
and the link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/v2.0.0/05_Implementation/ttl/ccts.ttl[ccts.ttl]
file for these definitions). There are some good reasons on which this decisions was based:
(1) The OP's MDR site does already maintain and supply the largest part of the code lists needed by ePO as a SKOS-XL syntax (named SKOS-AP-EU);
and (2) SKOS, and specially SKOS-XL, cater for a rich expressivity and metadata extensibility]); and
link:http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.2.html[UBL-2.2] (OASIS link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/v2.0.0/05_Implementation/ttl/ubl.ttl[Universal Business Language],
just the Period element, for the time being).

** Finally, the inputs from other ontology developments have been, and still are, appreciated and welcome. Thus the OCDS (link:https://www.open-contracting.org/events/ocds-ontologies-linked-data/[Open Contracting Partnership])
and PPROC (link:http://contsem.unizar.es/def/sector-publico/pproc.html[Public Procurement Ontology]) vocabularies where studied and lessons were drawn from them.

. *The Ontology must always be tested and perfected using a sufficiently large sample of real data*;

** The analysis and design of an Ontology cannot be declared as finished unless it is tested.
The Use Cases are only one of the essential elements to reach this goal.
However the testing cannot be trusted unless the data used are not (i) abundant, (ii) real data,
and (iii) with a certain degree of quality. In the case of the *eNotification* and *eAccess* phases
the use of the Tender Electronic Daily (TED) platform was proposed to retrieve, transform and load the
data contained in Contract Notice. Contract Notices contain the richest data related to the procurement
procedure and the contract awarded.


=== ePO governance

In order to develop these global deliverables the following Governance Structure, the following roles and responsibilities were established in ePO v1.00 and are still valid for the governance of the ePO v2.0.0:
