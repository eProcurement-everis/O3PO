== II. Information Requirements

According to the development plan, the first task was the identification of information requirements,
axioms and business rules. For this the version 2.0.0 of the ePO has taken into account the following inputs:

. The
    "link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki/Use-case-1.-Transparency-and-Monitoring[Use Case 1: Data Journalism]"
    and the link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki/Use--ase-4.-Analyzing-eProcurement-procedures[Use Case 4: Analysing eProcurement Procedures];

. The _Standards, business needs and Legislation**_ studied in the previous versions, plus the most recent developments;

. The _**EU eProcurement Glossary**_, maintained by the ePO Working group; see
link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/v2.0.0/02_IR_DED/eProcurement_glossary_and%20DED.xlsx[Glossary Management]
and link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki/Glossary-Management[Glossary].

This section covers the process applied for the elicitation of information requirements (see process "Information Requirement Elicitation" highlighted with
the largest semi-transparent blue box in the Knowledge Map below (rulin scope: "eNotification" and "eAccess; inputs: "ePO Glossary",
"Use Cases"; output: "DED 2.0.2". The upper blue box highlights the "ruling principles" that apply to the
entire development, including the elicitation of requirements.

The outcome of this task are namely two artefacts:

1. The _**Information Requirements**_ identified in ePO v1.0 link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki/Information-Requirements-v1.00[Information Requirements v1.00];

2. The _**Data Element Dictionary (DED v2.0.0)**_: a link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/v2.0.0/02_IR_DED/ePO_DED.xlsx[spread-sheet]
where the Use Case information requirements are broken down into more detailed information requirements, axioms, business rules and annotations resulting from the analysis.

=== The Data Element Dictionary (DED v2.0.0)

Information Analysts need to, based on each information requirement, make decisions like determining whether an element is an entity representing a _class_ of objects, an _attribute_ of the class of a basic data type e.g. a code, an identifier, a date, a time, a text, etc.), or a more complex _data object_ associated to the class (e.g. another class).

One way of listing this information is using a _**Data Element Dictionary**_, a table (e.g. a
link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/v2.0.0/02_IR_DED/ePO_DED.xlsx[spread-sheet])
with the following columns and rows:

==== Uses of the DED

The DED is normally used with three objectives:

. To *help analysts design the Ontology*. The DED is a "logical artefact". It takes the "Conceptual Data Model" as an input and reflects the
conceptual model and adds more technical details, such as all object and data properties of each class, their axioms and constraints. Sometimes,
as it has been in our case, it is developed simultaneously with the Conceptual Data Model;

. To *maintain the definitions of the data elements*. The ePO Glossary contains mainly the definitions of the concepts used in the Ontology. The
DED takes the definitions of the ePO Glossary for the classes and adds definitions *for each property* of each class;

. To *identify reference data linked to the data elements*, i.e. code lists and taxonomies;

. To *automatise the production of the model into different syntax bindings*. The DED is usually kept as a spread-sheet. This spread-sheet can be easily used to
generate XML, OWL or other machine-readable renditions of the data model. Thus it could be used to generate automatically the OWL-TTL expression
of the ePO Ontology. Specifications like UN/CEFACT and UBL use the DED to automatically generate XSD schemas fully annotated (documented) with the
data element definitions, examples, etc. This also facilitates the registration of these data elements in registries for their automatic
discovery and cross-sector mapping (See link:http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c035348_ISO_IEC_11179-6_2005(E).zip[ISO 11179-6:2015 Registration]
parts for more details on this).

==== Current status of the DED

The DED depends on the Glossary definitions and on the Conceptual Data Model, amongst other inputs for the elicitation of information requirements.
The ePO Glossary is currently under revision by the members of the Working Group. This revision makes evident how the Conceptual Data Model can be improved.

As the ePO Glossary is an ongoing work the DED cannot be considered finished. Additionally many of the DED properties will have to be defined
based on their context, the class where they belong in. These definitions are being worked on during the discussions about the ePO Glossary with the
Working Group.

==== Content of the DED

To the effects of using the DED to get a quick glimpse of the terms used in the ePO, their definitions just look
into the columns "Component Name" and "Definitions". The rest of columns are used to indicate the cardinality of the data element, to compose
the name of the class or property, and other information needed during the transformation of the DED into a specific syntax (e.g. into XML, Turtle, etc.).

The colour of the rows mean is intended to distinguish classes from properties:

* "**Pink rows**": represents a class. The rows between one pink row and another are the content of the class;

* "**Transparent rows**": represent a property of a class the range of which is an attribute (simple data type);

* "**Green rows**": represents a property of class the range of which is another class of the Ontology.
