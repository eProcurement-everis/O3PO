== II. Information Requirements

According to the development plan, the first task was the identification of information requirements,
axioms and business rules. For this the version 2.0.0 of the ePO has taken into account the following inputs:

. The
       "link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki/Use-case-1.-Transparency-and-Monitoring[Use Case 1: Data Journalism]"
       and the link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki/Use--ase-4.-Analyzing-eProcurement-procedures[Use Case 4: Analysing eProcurement Procedures];

. The _Standards, business needs and Legislation**_ studied in the previous versions, plus the most recent developments;

. The _**EU eProcurement Glossary**_, maintained by the ePO Working group; see
link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/v2.0.0/02_IR_DED/eProcurement_glossary_and%20DED.xlsx[Glossary Management]
and link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki/Glossary-Management[Glossary].

The outcome of this task are namely two artefacts:

1. The _**Information Requirements (IR v2.0.0)**_ already identified in link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki/Information-Requirements-v1.00[Information Requirements v1.00];

2. The _**Data Element Dictionary (DED v2.0.0)**_: a link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/v2.0.0/02_IR_DED/ePO_DED.xlsx[spread-sheet]
where the Use Case information requirements are broken down into more detailed information requirements, axioms, business rules and annotations resulting from the analysis.

=== The Data Element Dictionary (DED v2.0.0)

Information Analysts need to, based on each information requirement, make decisions like determining whether an element is an entity representing a _class_ of objects, an _attribute_ of the class of a basic data type e.g. a code, an identifier, a date, a time, a text, etc.), or a more complex _data object_ associated to the class (e.g. another class).

One way of listing this information is using a _**Data Element Dictionary**_, a table (e.g. a
link:ePO_DED.xlsx[spread-sheet])
with the following columns and rows:

==== Uses of the DED

The DED is normally used with three objectives:

. To *help analysts design the Ontology*. The DED is a "logical artefact". It takes the "Conceptual Data Model" as an input and reflects the
conceptual model and adds more technical details, such as all object and data properties of each class, their axioms and constraints. Sometimes,
as it has been in our case, it is developed simultaneously with the Conceptual Data Model;

. To *maintain the definitions of the data elements*. The ePO Glossary contains mainly the definitions of the concepts used in the Ontology. The
DED takes the definitions of the ePO Glossary for the classes and adds definitions *for each property* of each class;

. To *identify reference data linked to the data elements*, i.e. code lists and taxonomies;

. To *automatise the production of the model into different syntax bindings*. The DED is usually kept as a spread-sheet. This spread-sheet can be easily used to
generate XML, OWL or other machine-readable renditions of the data model. Thus it could be used to generate automatically the OWL-TTL expression
of the ePO Ontology. Specifications like UN/CEFACT and UBL use the DED to automatically generate XSD schemas fully annotated (documented) with the
data element definitions, examples, etc. This does also facilitates the registration of these data elements in registries for their automatic
discovery and cross-sector mapping (See link:http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c035348_ISO_IEC_11179-6_2005(E).zip[ISO 11179-6:2015 Registration]
parts for more details on this).

==== Current status of the DED

The DED depends on the Glossary definitions and on the Conceptual Data Model, amongst other inputs for the elicitation of information requirements.
The ePO Glossary is currently under revision by the members of the Working Group. This revision makes evident how the Conceptual Data Model can be improved. It also helps
identify elements that may be designed as object or data properties.

As the ePO Glossary is an ongoing work the DED cannot be considered finished. Additionally many of the DED properties will have to be defined
based on their context, the class where they belong in. These definitions are being worked out during the discussions about the ePO Glossary with the
Member States.

==== Content of the DED

The content of the DED is organised as follows:

**Columns**:

* **A - "IR#ID"**: Reserved to link each entry of the Dictionary (each element) with the general or concrete information requirement that generated
the class, attribute or property;

* **B - "ePO Business Term"**: Contains a label in English ("the term") assigned by the analysts to each class or property of the Dictionary.
Beware that: (i) _**A term is a set of one or more words that represent a concept**_; (ii) most of the concepts of the ePO Ontology are defined
in the link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/v2.0.0/02_IR_DED/eProcurement_glossary.xlsx[ePO Glossary]);
and (iii) the analysts sometimes decide to shorten the text (the label) of the term by combining differently the words of the term or by eliminating
some words (e.g. "Access Tool URI" instead of "URI of the Access Tool").
The reason for this is that at design and implementation time the name of the classes and properties need to be simple and yet self-explanatory.

* **C - "Concept Definition"**: The definition of each concept as it appears in the ePO Glossary.

* **D - "Examples**": When considered useful to better illustrate the concept, this column contains examples. Concept definitions should
not contain examples (hence the https://infostore.saiglobal.com/Store/Details.aspx?ProductID=1777745[ISO 11179-3:2015] defines a special field for
documenting the examples for data elements that may be registered for automatic discovery and reuse).

* **E - "Comments**: Notes and observations by the analysts that may be relevant at design time; e.g. "Buyer Category - This make sense especially,
but perhaps not uniquely, in the case of Framework Agreements where the Buyer can have an "Added Category"; or "Buyer Role - Two roles identified so
far: "Central Purchasing Body" and "Buyer On Behalf Of Other Procuring Entities", etc.

* **F - "Inheritance**": Some classes can already be proposed at this phase to be considered (at design time) as possible base (parent) classes;
e.g. the study and knowledge of the W3C Organization Ontology (identified with the prefix "org:") tells the analysts that the Buyer is a class that
can inherit many of its attributes from the the "org:Organization" class.

* **G - "Range**": Identifies the type of a data type or of an object type. The name of the column, "range", comes from the fact that these elements
can be seen as the "object" of a _**triple**_ composed of (i) a "subject", i.e. the class being analysed (the "domain"); (ii) a "predicate", i.e. the
property that links the subject and the object; and (iii) this "object".

* **H - "Cardinality**": Identifies the multiplicity and compulsorility of an element inside a class. The possibilities are: 1, meaning
"compulsory"; 1..n, meaning at least one instance is compulsory, but additional instances are also possible; 0..1, meaning optional and if used
maximum one instance; 0..n, meaning optional and if used multiple instances are possible.

* **J to M - in e-Forms, v1.00, OCDS, etc.**": used by the analysts to check whether this elements was defined in one of the studied ontologies,
standards or resources *related to the business domain* selected to be reused. Beware that other *generic* ontologies and vocabularies are also used or
reused by ePO, e.g. W3C org (Organization), W3C rov (Registered Organizations), ISA2's Core Criterion and Evidence Vocabulary, Dublin Core, vCard, FOAF, etc.

* **N - "Axioms**": Analysts while studying the data element MAY already identify certain elementary conditions to which the properties MAY be submitted,
e.g. transitivity, disjointness, reciprocity, etc.;

* **O - "Axiom Objects**": The object of the axiom; as in "Lots are disjoint with Groups of Lots" where "Groups of Lots" are the object of the
disjoint axiom, meaning that a specific procurement procedure that is divided into Lots will refer to individual Lots or to Groups of Lots but not to both;

* **P - "Business Rules**": Ontology constraints and axioms cannot control specific business rules, as when flexible cardinalities that in certain
situations need to be further restricted (e.g.: "If Procurement Procedure is divided into lots then cardinality should be 1"); or to check the values of
two or more fields that is present in different individuals (e.g., "If an economic group has already been registered the text of the group name should
match exactly the text kept in the registry. If this name is used in different places the text of the name MUST be always, and exactly, the same in all
those placeholders."

**Rows**:

* "**Pink rows**": represents a class. The rows between one pink row and another are the content of the class;

* "**Transparent rows**": represent a property of a class the range of which is an attribute (simple data type);

* "**Green rows**": represents a property of class the range of which is another class of the Ontology.
