== Annex I: Types of documents processed

During the development of the ETL process a certain effort was invested in analsying
which documents are published on TED, in which quantities, the variations month to month, etc.

It was interesting to confirm that the information already advanced by the OP for previous years
is consistent with the link:./images/ePO_stats_2018-JAN-MAY.xlsx[figures]footnote:[these figures
are produced automatically by the

and logged into a csv file in the directory `LOG_DATA_DIR` specified in the
`/home/user/epo.properties` file.]
obtained for the first months of 2018 (January to May), during
the ETL Transformation phase, e.g.:

. The most published documents are Contract Notices (F02) and Contract Award Notices (F03);

. The amount of one type of notice published is very regular (similar) all along the year;

. The average of documents published monthly is quite regular (around 45,000);

. Many eSenders are still using the old version R2.0.8 schema, especially for CN and CAN
(over 10% of the total in January and February, but it is a descending trend)

. Corrigenda (F14) are intensively used (around 10% of the documents published are corrigenda).
