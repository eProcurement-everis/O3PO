= eProcurement Ontology (ePO) Glossary
	
The following list of e-Procurement concepts have been identified through an analysis of the e-Notification and e-Access phases and also taking into account the labels in the *e-Forms*, to be used soon by all tenderers in the EU.
*e-Forms* are one of the actions in the Single Market Strategy, where the European Commission has committed to "facilitate the collection, consolidation, management and analysis of procurement data, supporting Member States’ efforts towards better governance in public procurement".

In the GitHub section link:https://github.com/eProcurement-everis/ePO/wiki/Glossary-Management[Glossary Management] you will find instructions of how to contribute to the enrichment and improvement of the ePO Glossary.

which takes its definitions from the ePO Glossary (click on the link to download this spreadsheet).

* Information about the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA)The procurement is covered by the Government Procurement Agreement(Source: eForms consultation).

* Council Decision 94/800/EC ( 1 ) approved in particular the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Government Procurement (the ‘GPA’). The aim of the GPA is to establish a multilateral framework of balanced rights and obligations relating to public contracts with a view to achieving the liberalisation and expansion of world trade. For contracts covered by Annexes 1, 2, 4 and 5 and the General Notes to the European Union’s Appendix I to the GPA, as well as by other relevant international agreements by which the Union is bound, contracting authorities should fulfil the obligations under those agreements by applying this Directive to economic operators of third countries that are signatories to the agreements.(Source: DIRECTIVE 2014/24/EU).

* The GPA is a plurilateral agreement within the framework of the WTO, meaning that not all WTO members are parties to the Agreement. (...) The fundamental aim of the GPA is to mutually open government procurement markets among its parties. As a result of several rounds of negotiations, the GPA parties have opened procurement activities worth an estimated US$ 1.7 trillion annually to international competition (i.e. to suppliers from GPA parties offering goods, services or construction services).(Source: World Trade Organization).
