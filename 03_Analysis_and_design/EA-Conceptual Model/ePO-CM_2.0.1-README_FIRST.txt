ePO-Conceptual Data Model version 2.0.1

Version 2.0.0 of the Conceptual Data Map was delivered on the 25th June 2018, jointly with the rest of deliverables 
(OWL TTL syntax, PoC software, Competency Questions, etc.).

As the work on the ePO Glossary was progressing with the cooperation of the Working Group members, the decision was
made of producing a new version 2.0.1 of the Conceptual Data Model to reflect changes derived from the discussions 
on the ePO Glossary and on improvements of the ontology.

The modifications introduced in the v.2.0.1 will be implemented at a later stage, once the Conceptual Data Model 
reaches a more stable stage.
